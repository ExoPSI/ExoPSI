# ExoPSI

ExoPSI is an open source Python package which offers similarity indexing of exoplanets in order to assess their habitability. It provides the capability to calculate similarity indices of different planetary candidates with respect to any reference values and any numerical parameter, yielding a more accurate evaluation of the survivability of different species. 

ExoPSI offers the ability to use any planet as a reference point and visualization functions that allow for easy comparison of the similarity between the interior and surface parameters of different planets. ExoPSI aims to help planetary sceince researches by offering a comprehensive solution for evaluating planetary similarities.
